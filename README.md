# Payment Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression
This project is a machine learning model that uses logistic regression to detect payment fraud.The dataset used has labelled dataset of over 39221 with 560 fraud transactions labels.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary libraries listed in the prerequisites.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file Payment Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression.ipynb.
4. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Usage
The notebook contains step-by-step instructions on how to use the logistic regression algorithm to detect payment fraud. The data is pre-processed, visualized, and then a logistic regression model is trained and evaluated. Finally, the model is used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Results
The results of the logistic regression model are displayed in the notebook, including evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The confusion matrix and ROC curve are also displayed to give a visual representation of the model's performance.
